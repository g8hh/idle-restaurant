				'The idea for food combination system came to me while playing Autochess mod for Dota2, but it wasn\'t like this originally. <br>\
At first, I thought about creating a game with just items and materials in it. Like, a hammer would be "wood, metal, tool", a screwdriver would be "plastic, metal, tool", etc. I wanted something that could be easily recognized at a glance and guessed by a player. <br>\
But there were many problems with that approach: like, what would bicycle be? Metal, rubber... maybe also plastic... Should it be categorized as a transport or a sports accessory? Proffessional bycicles are made from carbon... and a seat could be from leather or synthetic materials. Should that count? <br>\
There were just not very many interesting combinations there. <br>\
Furthermore, most electronics would be just plastic and metal (and glass for the screen), most furniture is wood, etc. <br>\
So that idea got scrapped pretty quickly.' +

So then I said to the kind lady that worked there "What would you recommend me to change in my order to fit my budget?". And I still remember noticing the enthusiasm and joy she had swapping positions in it. And she did an awesome job at that, even managed to fit a dessert in the end!<br>\

Like, starting a challenge and putting a lot of effort into it only to realize that you are not able to finish it on your level, ending up with a useless restaurant and a lot of resources spent. Or having to play the game actively when all you want is an idle experience. And also there would always be some percentage of players who will get completely stuck on a harder puzzle challenge, and just quit and don\'t get to experience the rest of the game\'s content.<br>So in the end the solution was to make region challenges optional, while still having a familiar progression mechanic as a base.' +

I got a lot of feedback about people liking to read these, but I can only write them when I have something interesting to say.<br>At least one of the players told me they actually dug deep into the game code to read these all at once, which was surprising and, I guess, high praise for my humble writing skills. :)<br><br>So, from the beginning, this was considered a True Idle game. And what I mean by that is that the game should not demand too much attention from the player during the day. Which, in part, means no profitable active/clicking mechanics.<br>Having a clicking mechanic that makes your progress much faster, in my opinion, is just a bad game design. Players will either use autoclickers or wear down their fingers, or they just will not use it, and feel bad that they can not progress at the intended speed.<br>This was the reason Dishwashing was originally made to only be good at the very start of the run, quickly becoming obsolete (as you\'d get a lot more money just by idling).<br>But the effect was the opposite - instead of comparing the Dishwashing income to Idle income (and choosing to ignore the Dishwashing), many players were still washing dishes (and regularly complaining in the comments that it doesn\'t give enough, but still not stopping). Seems like by spreading clicks over multiple buttons (to prevent autoclickers and finger damage) I have inadvertently made a mechanic that was entertaining enough on its own for a noticeable percentage of players. <br>But one thing stood out for me. Once I was searching the web to see mentions of my game and found a website that, amongst other things, provided a video "walkthrough" of my game. I was watching this 40-minute video where the author, clearly not knowing what else to do, just kept clicking dishwashing buttons, earning $300 game money for every 20 clicks (while earning tens of thousands every second from just idling)... and for some reason I just got this mental image of a kid, being frustrated, like, after arguing with their parents, just finding a random game on the internet and trying to just do something, click random buttons and stuff, while trying to keep themselves busy and work out their frustration.<br>And I thought "Well, my game is clearly not suitable for such situations, it wasn\'t intended to be. But wouldn\'t it be cool if it was, at least partially?". So I just made dishwashing scale with idle income. It still goes away later (at the point when it should become boring even for avid clicker fans) and it\'s still not really necessary for the progression, but now it can do a little bit more for some players. All the while, I hope, not destroying the idle feeling of the game too much.' +
